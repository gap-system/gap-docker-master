# Docker container for GAP development version

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/gap-system/gap-docker-master/master)

DockerHub entry: https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/gapsystem/gap-docker-master/

This container provides the core GAP system build from the `master` branch
of the [GAP repository](https://github.com/gap-system) and GAP packages
prepared for the next major release of GAP.
You can try it on mybinder.org via the "launch binder" badge above.

If you have installed [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), to use this
container first you need to download it using

    docker pull gapsystem/gap-docker-master

(the same command is needed if you need to update the GAP container to get a
new GAP release). After that, you can start it as follows:

    docker run --rm -i -t gapsystem/gap-docker-master

Note that you may have to run `docker` with `sudo`, particularly if you are
on Ubuntu.

The location of GAP in the container is `/home/gap/inst/gap-master`.

For more details (e.g. on how to access GAP running in this Docker container from a
Jupyter notebook in your browser) see the readme of https://github.com/gap-system/gap-docker
and simply replace `gap-docker` by `gap-docker-master`.
